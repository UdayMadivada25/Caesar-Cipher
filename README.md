# **Caesar Cipher üîê**

This is a simple **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption program written in **Python**. The **Caesar Cipher** is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places in the alphabet.

## **Features**
- Encrypts messages using the **Caesar Cipher** technique.
- Decrypts encoded messages back to their original form.
- Allows users to specify the shift value.
- Supports spaces and non-alphabetic characters without altering them.
- Interactive command-line interface.

## **How It Works**
1. The user chooses between **encryption** or **decryption**.
2. The user inputs a **message** to be encoded or decoded.
3. The user provides a **shift number** (how many places each letter should be shifted).
4. The program outputs the **transformed text**.

## **Installation & Usage**
